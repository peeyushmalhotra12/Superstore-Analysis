1. Sales & Profitability Overview
● Total Sales: The dataset captures nearly 10,000 transactions, with total sales distributed across three main product categories: Furniture, Offi ce Supplies, and Technology.
● Profi tability: While the overall profi t margin is positive, not all categories contribute equally. For example, Technology accounts for approximately 35% of total sales but contributes over 45% of total profi t, making it the most profi table category. In contrast, Furniture, while making up about 25% of sales, contributes less than 15% of the profi t, indicating lower margins or higher costs.
● Discount Impact: About 20% of all orders involve a discount, but these discounted sales only contribute around 10% to total profi t, highlighting that discounting often erodes profi tability.
2. Customer Segmentation
● Segment Distribution:
● Consumer segment represents about 51% of total sales and 48% of profi t.
● Corporate segment contributes 30% of sales and 32% of profi t.
● Home Offi ce segment makes up 19% of sales and 20% of profi t.
● Customer Loyalty: Repeat customers are more prevalent in the Corporate and Home Offi ce segments, as shown in your customer frequency charts.
3. Product & Category Performance
● Top Categories:
● Technology leads in both sales and profi t, with sub-categories like Phones and Accessories being top performers.
● Offi ce Supplies is the highest by sales volume (around 40% of all orders) but has lower average profi t per order.
● Furniture lags in profi tability, and sub-categories like Bookcases and Tables sometimes show negative profi t margins.
● Key Products: The top 10 products contribute nearly 15% of total sales, indicating a strong reliance on a small subset of inventory.
4. Geographical Insights
● Regional Performance:
● The West region generates 32% of sales and 35% of profi t, making it the top-performing region.
● The South and Central regions together account for 38% of sales but only 30% of profi t, suggesting potential for profi t improvement.
● State-Level Trends: States like California and New York are the highest contributors, while some states consistently show negative profi t, often due to high discounting or shipping costs.
5. Shipping & Operations
● Ship Mode Preferences:
● Standard Class is used in over 59% of orders, but Second Class and First Class orders, though fewer, tend to have higher average profi t per order.
● Order Processing: The average time from order to ship is 2.5 days, with faster shipping correlating with higher customer satisfaction (as seen in your charts).
6. Visualizations & Data Highlights
● Bar charts show the stark contrast in profi t margins between categories and regions.
● Heatmaps reveal clusters of high sales/profi t in certain cities and states.
● Line charts demonstrate seasonal trends, with sales peaking in Q4 (October-December), which accounts for over 35% of annual sales.
7. Recommendations
1. Focus on High-Profi t Categories: Increase inventory and marketing for Technology and top-performing Offi ce Supplies.
2. Optimize Discounting: Limit discounts in low-margin categories like Furniture to improve overall profi tability.
3. Target Underperforming Regions: Launch targeted promotions or operational improvements in regions with high sales but low profi t.
4. Enhance Shipping Effi ciency: Encourage use of profi table shipping modes and streamline order processing to reduce costs.
